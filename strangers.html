    <h2>Location</h2>  
   <p> Grand Central Terminal is a famous landmark in New York City. Within the Terminal there is a Whispering Gallery located at the lower level near the food court. The interlocking cieling design creates a space that echoes from one corner to the other.

        <h2>Research</h2>  
        <p> We asked the people interacting with the space if they were tourists or locals and what attracted them to the space. We also observed how many people passed through the area and what the demagraphic was. We collected this data and created a poster to visualize our findings. </p>

      <h2> Project Objective</h2>
      <p> The purpose of this project was to design a public art installation within the whispering gallery at Grand Central Terminal. We wanted encourage strangers to interact with the installation without instruction and create a unique experience within the space.</p>

      <h2> Iteration 1: The Glass Harp </h2>
      <p> We wanted to utilize the echo in the space and play with sound, so we installed a Glass Harp. This consisted of six wine glasses  that we set up in one of the corners filled with varying levels of water. When they are touched in a circular motion a sound emitts from the glass. At first it was difficult to get people to interact with it, since they were spontaneously placed with no eplanation. We decided to indicate how this was used and we drew the hand interaction with music notes to show that people could use this as an instrument. </p>

    <h2> Iteration 2: Projection </h2>
    <p> For our second iteration we tested our projection concept. We decided to try out a mini laserbeam projector that we projected onto the ceiling in one of the corners of the whispering gallery. We used this iteration to brainstorm ideas about what to project and how to make it attractive to strangers within the space. We decided to use visuals that were halloween themed and fun.  </p>

    <h2> Iteration 3: Halloween Projection </h2>
    <p> For our last iteration, we decided to expand on the second idea of using a halloween inspired projection and build off of this. Since we created this for the month of October, we decided to create a fun installation that would interest people through a spooky ghost visual that is projected onto the wall, an audio of the ghost speaking , and a baby doll that was a physical representation of the ghost’s baby. In the audio the ghost says “help me find my baby”, and the audience find the doll, which is placed in a bucket of candy. The audience is invited to take a candy reward as the audio switches and says “thank you for finding my baby”. At first we observed that people were scared of the visual, so we decided to add a sign that said Happy Halloween, to give it a more inviting appeal.   </p>

  <p> Many people were intimidated to approach the creepy projection,  </p>
